Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\\nfall, though.\\n\\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\\n\\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\\n\\n\\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don\\'t really know what the \"created\\nin His image\" means.

The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode.

Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\\nyou get the gist of it?

Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.',\n",

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

For example, I\\'ve had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\\n\\nI\\'ve had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\\n\\nMost revolvers are more \\'fragile\\' then semi auto\\'s.  There are all sorts\\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you\\'re out of the fight.\\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\\ninto that category.\\n\\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob\\'s \"The Semi\\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\\n\\nIn general, I\\'d agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\\n\\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\\nisn\\'t going to train them, they aren\\'t going to take the time on their\\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don\\'t bother.\\n\\nFor myself, I\\'d hate to be limited to one or the other.  I\\'d rather pick\\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I\\'m wearing that day\\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\\n\\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\\nRuger or Smith revolver....

As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start\\nsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time\\nunder whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining\\nto play a three-on-three game.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in\\nthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched\\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has\\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\\n\\nIt doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while\\nThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next\\nbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at\\n.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game\\nand giving up 6.6/game. \\n\\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \\nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\\nis a big question mark.\\n\\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\\n\\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\\n\\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there\\'s\\n\\tanother curve approaching)\\n\\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\\n\\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\\n\\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\\n\\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\\n\\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\\n\\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\\n\\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\\n5 speed)?  \\n\\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i\\'m sure there will\\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\\n',\n",

Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993.

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \\nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\\npeaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\\nmind...\\n\\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\\nintended for.\\n\\nThat doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\\nkill by their leaders.\\n\\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \\n\\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\\nparts of Man's history.@\\n\\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\\n\\nWell, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\\n\\n-ciao\",\n",

In 1941, \\nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \\ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \\nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \\ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \\ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \\nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \\nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \\nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \\nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler\\'s policy of \\nextermination of the Jews.\\n\\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\\n\\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \\n\\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \\nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \\nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \\nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \\nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide.

       " u'I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it. It is positively\\nthe worst car I have ever owned. I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles on\\nit when I sold it, and it was still going strong .  This is with religious\\nattention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in\\nexactly the same manner..\\n\\n  1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)\\n  2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)\\n  3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles\\n  4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)\\n  5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles\\n  6. Two timing belts.\\n  7. Constant error signals from computer.\\n\\n  8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging\\n     the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done\\n     last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because\\n     the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4\\n     weeks to get because it is on national back order. \\n\\n     Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new\\n     design in 87.

       " u'\\nYes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.\\nHowever, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all\\nfive schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against\\nmuslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do\\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\\nthat\\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\\nby the death penalty.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Khomeini\\'s ruling was not based on the\\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\\n\\n\\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\\nof the book. However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.',\n",

The big problems I have encountered in\\nporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of\\ninvalid C++ assumptions.\\n\\nI have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but\\nthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in\\nwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are\\ngetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the\\nowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all\\nother pieces of ctrltest work fine.\\n\\nTwo other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:\\n\\n- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,\\n  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ\\n  between MSC and BC).\\n\\n- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++\\n  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place\\n  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for\\n  references).\\n\\nI am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have\\nnot encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope\\nthat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's\\nhype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.\\n\",\n",

       " u'Yep thats pretty much it Im not a Jew but I understand that this is the Jewish way of thinking However the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs Abraham and Moses in this case establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall though As I understand it the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required whereas the Pharisees the ancestors of modern Judaism believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances Talmud The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH for a Jew or Christian and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship although one can speculate The trouble with all of this is that we dont really know what the created in His image means Ive heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation to mix metaphors unashamedly As to living by Christs example we know very little about Jesus as a person We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers and some very small references from comtemporary historians Revelation aside one can only know Christ secondhand or worse This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity although it may seem that way initially the point Im trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret and that interpretation is by humanity I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness No There may be an absolute moral code There are undoubtably multiple moral codes The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code As an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is wrong Now the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar where there are no children The wrongness here is if the child disobeys the parent The parent may feel that it is inappropriate to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent and may be a parent later in life but you get the gist of it Incidentally the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older see Piaget and learns a morality of his own David On religion',\n",

away all he has and all hes ever gonna have Will Munny Unforgiven I am beyond the under age group but I have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you I owned a Toyota Celica GT I decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche model years I narrowed it down to those two I liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a Porsche The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the but i decided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car If you buy the Supra your rate classification will be the same as the Celica the Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be years newer Our lowerrisk division will continue to handle your account If you buy the Porsche well have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double And if you go with a its another story again well cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that But the Supra is much faster than the and the is actually faster than the standard That doenst make sense Thats what the book says We dont insure Corvettes either For some reason the underwriters consider Supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressure guy in the back room At equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche plus its higher insurance I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft Everyones entitled to MY opinion goldbergoasysdtnavymil Imagination is more important than

widewavelength Angstrom Xray telescope Xray CCD cameras and imaging gas scintillation proportional counters CASSINI Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe Cassini is a joint NASAESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IVCentaur in October of After gravity assists of Venus Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of Upon arrival the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around Saturn Near the end of this initial orbit the Huygens Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of Titan The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about hours while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface After the completion of the Probe mission the Orbiter continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about flybys of Titan and targeted flybys of Iapetus Dione and Enceladus The objectives of the mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of Saturns atmosphere rings and magnetosphere conduct closeup studies of Saturns satellites and characterize Titans atmosphere and surface One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere These hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini the first director of the Paris Observatory who discovered several of Saturns satellites and the major division in its rings The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens who discovered Titan and first described the

their abode in fanatic Turkey when they were expelled from Europe especially Spain by Saintly Christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers To one brought up as most Americans have been in the Gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable One readily reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate He also stated that they Armenians traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population I want the documents of Jews in Latvia I think several other people on socculturegreek are already disputing with you about the Turkish Genocide Is this the

and Modern Turkey Volume II Reform Revolution Republic The Rise of Modern Turkey London Cambridge University Press pp In April Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city of Van whose Armenians comprised percent of the population closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the EmpireLeaving Erivan on April Armenian volunteers reached Van on May and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other invading Russian armies Their hope was their participation in the Russian

jokes Iam arguing about the ArmenianNazi colaboration during World War II Any comment It could be perhaps your head wasnt screwed on just right In while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis In this battalion had grown into eight battalions of strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the shortlived Armenian Dictatorship and the architect of the coldblooded genocide of million Turks and Kurds between An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis Encouraged by this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitlers policy of extermination of the Jews This ArmenianNazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they backstabbed and exterminated million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army Furthermore as McCarthy put it the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies October The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics Only the area called Cilicia around the Ottoman province of Adana was to be excluded as it had already been claimed by the French The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks who could be expected to oppose their plans On April the British Army occupied Kars gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians then withdrew The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship even though the Russian prewar census had shown Kars Province to be over Muslim The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed but the British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia Murder pillage genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army The British had left the scene to the Armenian genocide squads Therefore few Europeans were present to observe the genocide One British soldier Colonel Rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers saw what was occurring Rawlinson wired to his superiors in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslim population as their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control

destroyed as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of these cities were deliberately burnt by Armenians apart from the destruction suffered during the twoyear Russian occupation All barracks buildings of Erzincan the cavalry barracks in Erzurum the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those burnt In short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down As to the people of these cities All people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the Sarikamis direction for road building and were slaughtered The remaining people were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts The few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than those of the Spanish Inquisition are in poverty more dead than alive horrified some driven insane about in Erzincan and in Erzurum The people are hungry and in poverty for whatever they had has been taken away from them their lands left uncultivated The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in stores left over from the Russians The villages round Erzincan and Erzurum are in the worst condition Some villages on the road have been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely massacred Let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that history has

       " u'Yes this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws However I believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all five schools of law sunni and jaffari can be levelled against muslim or nonmuslims both within and outside daralislam I do not know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent and open hostility to Islam falls into this category of the law I do know that historically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone by the death penalty My understanding is that Khomeinis ruling was not based on the law of apostasy alone It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Quran hadith or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of fasad This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what I remember was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book However the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser charges I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people not books The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa Rushdie went on a media blitz presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book he was everywhere in the media Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights It was at this point that the fatwa on fasad was issued The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well The crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being played out and played up in the the full view of the media',\n",
